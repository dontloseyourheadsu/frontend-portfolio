      "details": "This project implements a custom memory allocator that outperforms standard malloc/free in specific scenarios. It uses a segregated free list approach and supports custom alignment. Key features include: \n- O(1) allocation and deallocation for fixed-size blocks.\n- Low fragmentation overhead.\n- Thread-safe implementation using atomic operations.",
